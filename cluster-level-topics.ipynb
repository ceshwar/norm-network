academia similar field to be honest this really doesn t make sense what kind of program did you graduate from that they didn t offer you a one year lecturer position while you went on the market for a second year this is really common because lit jobs are few and far between and that s especially true for the top programs it impacts their rankings for their phds to not get tt jobs so they really aren t likely to just shrug and wave goodbye when you don t get a job your first year out it looks good on them for you to get that job even after a couple of years applying i d say the bigger tifu is taking 8 years to do a spanish lit phd that s entirely too long and perhaps why the program you were in didn t offer another year of support i really disagree with the advice to not finish your phd or get another one people should finish as soon as they can while still doing good work to show their programs and prospective employers that they know how to work efficiently and that they re not dragging their feet with the thesis if someone applied to a position in my department having done two back to back phds for 16 years assuming 8 each i d figure that they know exactly zilch about how the market works and might be a colleague i would have to explain practical day to day things to on a regular basis also a top tier program wouldn t have you spending 2000 out of pocket to do interviews they comp you for things like the mla conference that amount of money and the fact that you apparently spent it yourself without reimbursement does not make sense and in a city like austin where the mla was this year it shouldn t cost that much for two hotel nights and a flight especially if you share the room with another student finally a phd in spanish lit doesn t qualify you for just teaching spanish 101 in what world you should have had experience teaching a wide variety of language and content courses throughout your phd and that s what you d be expected to do as a tt faculty member and last edit to my rant universities are gobbling up phds for lecturer and adjunct positions plenty of departments don t have graduate programs so they wouldn t have students to give them to and there s such a glut of phds from the last 6 years that departments can choose who they want and they want phds because it looks better for the materials they send to prospective undergrad students so they can brag about the qualifications of their faculty adjunct through tenure line tt tenure track mla modern language association conference a biggie for language degrees it s common to do first round face to face interviews there after search committees have reviewed all applications side note it can also be awkward af because the interviews are sometimes in actual hotel rooms i had

listeners also op got to spend nearly a decade of her life doing something she truly loves plus she met her husband while she was in the program not a bad deal but it ll be even better once she can figure out how to land a job that lets her continue using her skillset to do cool things inside academia or out tl dr op doesn t understand the market took too long on her thesis needs to look to her home department for better support permalinkembedsaveparentreportgive goldreply po2gdhaekayk 191 points 1 day ago i have a phd at a top 5 international institution and did my first postdoc at one of the ivies i m currently back at my phd institution doing a second fellowship last year i applied to around 6 8 permanent posts received interviews but no jobs i m not complaining i m pointing out that my situation is the norm right now in academia if you want an academic post at a top 100 research institution note that you are competing against people from oxford cambridge yale harvard etc if you are applying to smaller teaching colleges you are also getting a lot of top candidates from top schools who are not as heavy into research that s the competition quite frankly the op is simply ignorant of the current situation in academia and should have informed themselves by speaking with colleagues as you say 8 years to finish a phd is much too long the op claims to have worked 60 70 hours a week i doubt that very much either that or this is the most terrifically inefficient phd ever i might be overly harsh but the op has been living in a bubble for 8 years tl dr if you are doing a phd don t finish it if you finish it apply for another one the only time you will be in academia is if you are a student the is just terrifically poor advice and i find it infuriating the op is basically feeding the source of the problem which he she is complaining about the real lesson is not to do a phd unless you have properly informed yourself of what you intend to do with the phd and moreover have investigated the likelihood of this scenario occurring the problem is not to encourage a saturated market of overqualified phd holders who should not have done a phd in the first place instead we re getting a lot of phd candidates who do an advanced degree because they love learning then they spend 8 years doing a degree that should really be finished in 3 5 don t inform themselves

      "i don t think ohio was ever looking to purposely establish that but the definition of rape just happens to be well written enough to be gender neutral sexual conduct is gender specific to male and female in regards to the definition of vaginal intercourse but i think that s because trans or other non binary genders aren t recognized as legal genders overall the sexual misconduct laws are fairly liberal in how they can be implemented but it s not because there was some sort of affirmative consent campaign it s just that the laws were written in a very neutral form the other thing is that threatening to call the police unless someone has sex with you is probably not going to be considered rape because it doesn t involve force or breaking someone s resistance through intoxication although i kind of wonder if it s possible to argue that anyway ohio doesn t have a sexual assault law but instead has sexual battery and sexual imposition laws this is important because depending on what the offender does what the offender knows and how the offender coerces the victim changes up the charges that s because the lesser charges also switch from using sexual conduct to sexual activity and sexual contact which in layman s terms i would say is at least anything you would see in softcore porn so although the law doesn t clearly talk about consent per say what it talks about instead is what the offender does and what efforts the offender takes to get around resistance what this means is that you might be able to argue that sexual battery occurred because orc 2907 03 a 1 the offender knowingly coerces the other person to submit by any means that would prevent resistance by a person of ordinary resolution which might be vague enough to work gross sexual imposition is still partially defined with force or threat of force but sexual imposition orc 2907 06 a 1 the offender knows that the sexual contact is offensive to the other person or one of the other persons or is reckless in that regard which would definitely work however orc 2907 06 b no person shall be convicted of a violation of this section solely upon the victim s testimony unsupported by other evidence and orc 2907 06 c whoever violates this section is guilty of sexual imposition a misdemeanor of the third degree so while you could definitely hit the offender with sexual imposition because they are trying to coerce you through trying to get false charges or even as low as threatening to spread nasty rumors about you you must have additional hard evidence and you have to recognize that it s going to be a 3rd degree misdemeanor which isn t very much but if you have the evidence you can additionally hit them with orc 2917 32 making false alarms making or threatening to make false police reports that starts off as a 1st degree misdemeanor and becomes significantly worse as more state resources are involved or 2905 12 coercion which definitely fits the bill and that starts off as a 2nd degree misdemeanor so it s okay but it s not all great also we ve been in a stupid humid heat wave spell for way too fucking long nothing like sleeping a muggy 85 o night to piss you off for the next morning\n",

      "not a historian so take what i say with a grain of salt after the fall of the western roman empire in the late 5th century there was a decline in literacy in western europe with martial germanic nobility replacing the roman patrician aristocracy this decline in literacy coupled with the decline of cities and urban centers led to difficulty with record keeping and without record keeping you can t have beurocracy which survived and thrived in the eastern roman empire the decline of beurocracy led to great difficulties with taxation meaning that maintaining standing armies became difficult although not impossible the merovingians for example maintained the roman legions along the rhine well into the 6th century and after conquering burgundy maintained the relatively large and well armed standing army of the burgundians this went into decline during the early 8th century and was somewhat revived by the carolingians another cause for the popularity of feudalism may have been the rise of germanic nobility since it is believed that the germanic principle of kingship was similar to feudalism i m sure this is chock full of mistakes and i will be happy to be corrected where applicable\n",

      "to understand how the leader of the roman catholic church came to be based in rome you have trace the intertwining history of the early christian church with that of byzantine empire and succession of political changes in the italian peninsula nbsp st peter is generally thought of as the first pope or the bishop of rome although he was never referred to as such by his contemporaries now what came after peter is somewhat shrouded in the haze of history but it wasn t until the edict of milan that decriminalized christianity in the roman empire followed by the edict of thessalonika that declared nicene christianity as the state religion of the roman empire did the position of pope or rather the bishop of rome take some official form at this point it should be noted that the catholic church had not yet been born but is starting to take shape with the first ecumenical councils starting with the council of nicaea which starts clarifying the official state church doctrines nbsp now it should be noted that the bishop of rome was one amongst many bishops in other areas and that rome was one of many centers of early christianity others being antioch alexandria thessaloniki and of course jerusalem among others nbsp however would be logical since christianity by now is the state religion of the roman empire the bishop of capital city of the empire should attain primacy over the others and thus be called pope as we know the roman empire was divided between east and west and the western roman empire with its capital in rome was the weaker of the two and quickly fell to barbarian invasions the eastern empire with its capital in constantinople was hold for another millenia after the fall of the western empire although the eastern empire still held onto rome that city was no longer in the center of the empire and therefore for a long time the bishop of rome was not based in rome but in the capital city of constantinople because it was the new rome nbsp after the byzantines lost control of rome this where things started to get ugly you had new political entities and kingdoms ie lombards franks hre in control of rome and of course these new kings required religious blessings to legitimize their rule so the bishops physically in rome at this time now started to contend with the bishop of rome in constantinople and refused to defer to the divine authority of the pope in constantinople eventually the churches in western europe and eastern europe developed doctrinal differences as well being under the influence of competing empires byzantium versus hre that their differences became irreconcilable and lead to the great schism in 1054 whereupon the roman catholic church was officially established with the bishop of rome now actually located in the city of rome as its pope\n",
